## üéØ Overview

CyberChain Explorer simulates a blockchain network with:

- **Proof-of-work mining** with adjustable difficulty
- **Cryptographic hash chains** linking blocks together
- **Transaction system** with metadata embedding
- **Treasure hunt** with 7 hidden clues distributed across the blockchain
- **80s cyberpunk aesthetic** with terminal-style interface

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Open the HTML file** in any modern web browser
2. **Mine your first block** by clicking "MINE BLOCK"
3. **Explore blocks** to find treasure transactions
4. **Collect all 7 clues** to reveal the secret key
5. **Analyze metadata** to reconstruct the final treasure

## üéÆ How to Play

### Mining Blocks

- Click **"MINE BLOCK"** to generate new blocks
- Each block contains random transactions
- Some blocks contain **treasure transactions** with embedded clues
- Watch the status bar for clue discoveries!

### Exploring the Chain

- Use **"EXPLORE BLOCK"** to browse all blocks
- Click any block to see detailed transaction information
- Look for transactions to special addresses (like `0x1337c0de`)
- Treasure transactions are highlighted in purple

### Finding the Treasure

- **7 clues** are hidden across different blocks
- Each clue contains a narrative hint and secret key fragment
- Use **"SCAN TRANSACTIONS"** to filter treasure-only transactions
- Use **"ANALYZE METADATA"** to reconstruct the final secret

## üîß Technical Features

### Blockchain Implementation

- **Block Structure**: Index, timestamp, transactions, previous hash, nonce
- **Mining Algorithm**: Proof-of-work with configurable difficulty
- **Hash Chain**: Cryptographic linking ensures block integrity
- **Transaction Pool**: Pending transactions await mining

### Cryptographic Elements

- **SHA-like hashing** for block integrity
- **Nonce-based mining** simulation
- **Address system** with hexadecimal formatting
- **Metadata embedding** for clue distribution

### Treasure Hunt Mechanics

- **Special Addresses**: `0x1337c0de`, `0xdeadbeef`, `0xcafebabe`, etc.
- **Clue Distribution**: One clue per treasure address
- **Fragment Assembly**: Secret key reconstructed from all fragments
- **Progressive Discovery**: Each clue provides hints for the next

## üé® Design Features

### Retro Aesthetic

- **Terminal-style interface** with monospace fonts
- **Neon color scheme** (green, cyan, magenta)
- **CRT glow effects** and text animations
- **80s cyberpunk terminology** and styling

### User Experience

- **Real-time status updates** during mining and exploration
- **Progress tracking** with visual progress bar
- **Interactive block selection** for exploration
- **Animated mining process** with visual feedback

## üîç Understanding the Code

### Core Classes

```javascript
CyberChain; // Main blockchain controller
Block; // Individual block with mining capability
Transaction; // Transaction data with metadata support
```

### Key Functions

- `minePendingTransactions()` - Creates and mines new blocks
- `generateTreasureTransactions()` - Embeds clues in transactions
- `calculateHash()` - Generates cryptographic hashes
- `mineBlock()` - Proof-of-work mining algorithm

### Status System

- **BLOCKS**: Number of mined blocks (excluding genesis)
- **CLUES**: Treasure discovery progress (X/7)
- **DIFFICULTY**: Mining complexity (leading zeros required)
- **STATUS**: Dynamic status based on hunt progress

## üéØ Educational Goals

### Blockchain Concepts

- **Distributed Ledger**: Chain of cryptographically linked blocks
- **Proof-of-Work**: Computational puzzle solving for consensus
- **Immutability**: Historical transactions cannot be altered
- **Transparency**: All transactions visible and verifiable

### Cryptographic Principles

- **Hash Functions**: Deterministic, one-way mathematical functions
- **Digital Signatures**: Transaction authenticity (simulated)
- **Merkle Trees**: Transaction verification (conceptual)
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Agreement in distributed networks

## üîß Customization

### Adjusting Difficulty

```javascript
this.difficulty = 2; // Requires 2 leading zeros (00)
```

### Modifying Treasure Hunt

```javascript
this.secretKey = "YOUR_SECRET_HERE";
this.treasureAddresses = ["0xYOUR_ADDR", ...];
```

### Changing Aesthetics

- Modify CSS variables for different color schemes
- Adjust animations and glow effects
- Customize terminal styling and fonts

## üöÄ Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Mobile**: Responsive design works on tablets/phones
